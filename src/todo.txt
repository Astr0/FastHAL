+ replace Loki with brigand
+ rename port to Field and FieldBit to FieldBit, simplify port interface
+ constexpr interface 
+ interface with action factories and apply
+ read with apply
+ integral constant instead of static actions, remove static actions, make them use element_holder
+ vport on actions
+ everything on actions (remove normal)

* typed and masked mport?
* type for vport?
* check/refactor ADC code
* design something n1ce for interrupts
* check/refactor serial code, make streaming using same constexpr interface as pins/ports
* design some kind of HAL (with linking to what pin where and Arduino pin numbering?) so one could select pinMode, do IO, ADC and intterupts? do we need it???
* map a lot of useful AVR registers in process

+ replace Loki with brigand
+ rename port to Field and FieldBit to FieldBit, simplify port interface
+ constexpr interface 
+ interface with action factories and apply
+ read with apply
+ integral constant instead of static actions, remove static actions, make them use element_holder
+ vport on actions
+ everything on actions (remove normal)
+ typed and masked mport?
+ type for vport
+ check/refactor ADC code
+ design something n1ce for interrupts
+ convenient begin() and convert() for ADC
+ check/refactor serial code. Define buffers with ifdefs for each uart (switches mode)

* make streaming using same constexpr interface as pins/ports

* Fix ringbuffer so 1 bytes is ok (tail and head moves out of range and % later)
* add value type checks for port/fieldbit/other methods to restict templates and bring some type safety
* design some kind of HAL (with linking to what pin where and Arduino pin numbering?) so one could select pinMode, do IO, ADC and intterupts? do we need it???
* map a lot of useful AVR registers in process
* do something great with this library

* we're pretty much on C++17, so we can use if constexpr and auto template parameters where needed
